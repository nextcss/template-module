## TypeScript

Since we don't use TypeScript, any issue with TypeScript is your business. For more information, see
the Typescript documentation. If you're having problems with TypeScript, here are some hints that
might get you started:

- `esModuleInterop` option in `compilerOptions`
- `allowJs` option in `compilerOptions`
- `declare module "*"` definition in `declarations.d.ts`
